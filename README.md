# CodeGitOverflow

CodeGitOverflow is a Q&A coding platform designed to address the challenges faced by users on StackOverflow. Our goal is to provide an improved user experience with the following features:

## Security on Client Side
We prioritize your data security. Our platform uses secure tampering and encryption libraries to ensure that your data is safe. Only necessary information like your username is displayed when asking questions.

Also, to ensure more security any JavaScript file meant for handling data or encryption will not be viewable by using Python to route away from those files.
## Improved Features
- **Instant Updates**: Get instant reloads when a question you are following is updated.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications when your question receives an update.
- **Multiple Questions**: Feel free to ask multiple questions, even if your previous ones were closed.

## User-Friendly Policies
- **No Penalties for Closed Questions**: We believe in learning from mistakes. Having your questions closed will not penalize your account.
- **Recommended Answers**: We use cookies to recommend answers, enhancing your user experience on our platform.

## Free to Use
CodeGitOverflow is completely free for anyone to use.

## Backend Technologies
We use PHP and MySQL for our backend. This allows us to store and manage data like comments, replies, upvotes, downvotes, and usernames. This data is fetched and rendered on your browser. Each question has its own page, ensuring a clean and organized user interface.

Join us in our journey to make coding Q&A a better experience!
